<p>
  Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world
  as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round
  earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center
  because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy
  as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a
  globe in practice, not in theory.
