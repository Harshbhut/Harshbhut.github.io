  - Why we need to Invest ?
</h2> -->

<p>
  When we heard about personal finance most of us tried to get rid of it by saying that it is not my cup of tea or it should be handle by my financial advisor.
</p>

<p>Wait...Think for a minute...</p>

<p>
  Does advisor know your financial condition better than you ? If No, Then How they able to handle your money ?
</p>

<p>
  Let's, Invest some time in ourself and handle our hard-earned money so wisely that
  <b style="color: #0609d4;">money works for us </b> not we work for money.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #f6461a">
  50/30/20 Rule
</h3>

<img src="/img/financial-ind.webp" alt="Financial Independece" align="middle" />

<p>
  50% of your income should go to Necessities, 30% should go to luxuries and wants & 20% should go to Investment.
</p>

<p>
  Now, you may think that I don't have any money to save or Invest after my expenses what is the way to go forward?
</p>

<p>
  Usually, when we receive money in our pocket We first spent it on our expenses so the calculation is like, <b>Savings = Income - Expenditure</b> 
  but ideally we should do a reverse calculation here.
</p>

<h5 style="color: #0ebb2b">
  Expenditure = Income - Savings
</h5>



<p>
  Out of your total capital first, save it and whatever is left that should be your expenses.
</p>

<p>
  Suppose If you still have some money left after necessities & luxuries expenses then add into your 20% money which is saving or investment. 
</p>

<p>
  Now, Let's go to the most promising way to financial independence -<b><span style="color: #0609d4;">Investment</span></b>
</p>
<p>
  Whenever we start any work we have some pre-define goals and a way to achieve it, the same formula apply in investing if we don't have any goals in investing its like sail a boat without a destination. So, First, we need to define our goals for investing. Mainly there are 3 types of goals in investing.
</p>

<h5 style="color: #000000">
  - Short term  - (0-2 years) </br> - Medium-term  - (3-9 years) </br> - Long term  - (10-14 years)
</h5>
<p>
  After defining goals a question is where to put our capital such a way that it works for us? In, Next blog, I will share a different way to divide your investment into different instruments.
