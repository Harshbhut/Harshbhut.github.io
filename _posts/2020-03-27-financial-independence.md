  - Why we need to Invest ?
</h2> -->

<p>
  When we heard about personal finance most of us try to get rid of it as soon
  as possible by saying that it is not my cup of tea or it should be handle by
  my financial advisor.
</p>

<p>Wait...Think for an minute..</p>

<p>
  Does other person know your financial condition better than you ? If No, Can
  they able to handle your money better than you ?
</p>

<p>
  Then, How can we handle our hard earned money so wisley that
  <b>money works for us </b> not we work for money ?
</p>

<p>
  Here, I try to explain some basic rules of finance that lead your money to
  works for you.
</p>

<p>
  By looking at this you might think that I don't have any savings to invest,
  what should I do ? and it's normal thought that comman people have.
</p>
<p>
  Usually when we recieve money via any source in our pocket We first spent it
  on our expenses, <b>Savings = Income - Expenditure </b> but ideally we should
  do following reverse calculation here.
</p>

<h5 style="color: #0ebb2b">
  Expenditure = Income - Savings
</h5>
