  2. Post Office Schemes
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is like a savings account with a bank, except that it is held with a post office. There are 
  various saving and FD schemes available to invest. You can get all the detail of schemes from 
  official <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiapost.gov.in/Financial/pages/content/post-office-saving-schemes.aspx" style="color: red;">Post Office Saving Schemes</a> website.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
 <b> Now, You might ask a question why should we go for POS rather than bank schemes ?</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Just think what if banks go bankrupt ? What about your savings ? How much you get back are the entire value or some fixed value ? 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Aww..wait, Don't stand up and rush to the bank and withdraw all your savings. There is a provision for this type of crisis. In FY 2020-21 budget
  The Finance minister proposed an increase in insurance amount for depositors in case of bank failure, the RBI has announced an 
  increase in insurance cover to ‚Çπ5 lakh per depositor, from ‚Çπ ‚Çπ1 lakh. 
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">
 <b>Here are 2 things to know about this scheme:</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  1) All types of bank deposits including savings, 
  fixed and recurring, are covered under the scheme. The ‚Çπ5 lakh limit covers both principal and interest amount.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  2) It is to be noted that this deposit guarantee is involved only if the bank gets closed. 
  It cannot be released if the bank is a going concern.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now, what if your aggregated about exceed 5 lakh in particular bank? You will lose your entire capital. To be risk free in these situations
  I recommend every individual to maintain 1 POS account for their family becasue POS completely secure in nature as it's 
  backed by the Government of India & it's never to get closed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I hope you will consider this saving options and try to maintain your capital in a place where your risk is less or zero.
</p>

  3. Bullion
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Investment in Gold & Silver is favorite for all Indian consumer but rather than buying gold as an investment option we generally see as security in nature.
 Mostly we buy gold in forms of jewelry and generally not even think about selling gold unless and until there is a financial crisis.
</p>
<p>
There is a risk of theft in physical form and also if you put it in a bank locker than charges of lockers need to be considered while investing in physical gold.
On the other side nowadays the government is promoting buying gold in digital form. Gold in digital form fetches same return as gold in physical form and
Gold in digital helps liquidity in the economy.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Government is running an scheme of <b> Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) </b> to encourage people to buy gold in digital format. SGB also fetches 
the additional annual retun of 2.5% on purchasing of gold bond. You can checkout all the details on NSE website  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/about-sgb" style="color: red;">here</a>.

<h4 style="color: #000080;">
  4. Real Estate 
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Real Estate sector is one of the most internationally renowned sectors.
  In India, real estate is the second major sector/employer following agriculture. In the Covid pandemic situation Real Estate is the most underperformed 
  sector amongst others. Also, Real estate sector highly unliquidated, We can't sell or buy property in a day therefore by looking current economic 
  situation it's not advisable to invest in any real estate property.  
</p>


<h4 style="color: #000080;">
  5. Bonds/Debentures 
</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Bonds/Debentures are a kind of debt instrument where the issuer (Govt agencies & Companies) of the bond has taken a fixed amount from a person/institute and paid the 
  intrest at pre-define rate & principal at time of maturity. The bonds generally have some locking period typically in the range of 5-10 years.
  This lock in period is also known as the maturity period of the bonds/debentures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Investing in debt mutual fund consider as a safer option than equity market but there are mainly 2 risk associated with bonds/debentures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h5 style="color: red;">
  Credit Risk
</h5>
  Credit risk is a measure of a borrower‚Äôs ability to repay a loan and the interest charged on that loan. There might be a chance that companies failed
  to pay interest and principal amount to the bondholders. In that case, before issuing any debt instrument to the public there has to be a credit risk 
  rating for the bonds/debentures. A high rating means there are very few chances of default on payment or vice versa.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <h5 style="color: red;">
    Interest Risk
  </h5>
    A Interest risk is a risk associated with the interest rates changes of any economy. If intrest rates are lower then respectively value of olders
    bonds are goes higher because whichever new bonds will assign in future that interest rate is lower than the previous. If interest rates are higher in economy
    then older bonds value is decrease compared to the new bonds.
  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Mainly people will invest in debt instrument via debt Mutual Fund. There are many types of debt funds including 
  corporate bond, liquid bond, overnight bond , short duration bond, long term bond. You can checkout all the debt & equity mutual funds avaialble from

<h4 style="color: #000080;">
  5. Equity (Shares)
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An equity market or share market is a market where shares(very small part) are issued and traded, It is one of the most vital areas of a market economy because it gives companies access to capital and investors 
  a slice of ownership in a company with the potential to realize gains based on its future performance. A companies shares can be through exchanges and it can 
  be hold in a demate account. A person can open a demate account with any brokers associated with exchanges. I personally prefer to have an account
  with <a href="https://zerodha.com/open-account?c=UR4102" target="_blank" style="color: red;">Zerodha</a> & <a href="https://upstox.com/open-demat-account/?utm_source=refernearn&utm_medium=referral&landing_page=ReferAndEarn&f=GOD4" target="_blank" style="color: red;">Upstox</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Equity market will give you high returns if an investment made upon certain parameters while managing the risk.</p>
  <p>
  Reliance got listed on stock exchange in 1977. 10,000 Rs invested in reliance at the time of IPO now it become more than 2,10,00,000. while on the other side
  10,000 Rs invested in Reliance power IPO in 2008 got vanished and just left with 4 Rs. So before investing in equity market an in depth study required or 
  a person can invest through mutual fund.
