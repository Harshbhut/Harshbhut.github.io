<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I hope you have done your analysis on your spending habits and started saving
  money by cutting down your undesired wants and spending habits.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now, We have some amount of cash in our hands to start investing in various
  available options in the market. Some of you might already be started investing in
  mutual funds but before started investing in any instrument, think for a second
  and ask yourself a question <b>Do I have any specific goal to Invest?  </b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If your answer is <b style="color: red;">No</b>, Then it sounds like
  <span style="font-style: italic; color: #808080;">
    "you are sitting in a taxi and asking a driver to just move
    wherever he wants to go and when he asks for a destination, you just tell him
    keep going I will tell you where I want to go afterward.
  </span>
  this should not belong to us, right? We should have a destination to go in journey as well as in investment. We must have a specific goal and a plan to fulfill it, So
  let's check out how to set our smart goals in investing.
</p>

<p>
  Let's understand it in terms of investing by an example. The actual scenario might
  different and it's based on the individual.
</p>

<p>
  <b><span style="color: #de4645;">Specific</span></b> - I want to buy a car.
  <br />
  <span style="font-style: italic;">
    - Here, I want to buy something and that is a car, so it's a specific
    goal.</span
  >
</p>

<p>
  <b><span style="color: #f9a824;">Measurable</span></b> - I need to save 10
  Lacs to buy a car. <br />
  <span style="font-style: italic;"
    >- Here, I require specific amount that will need in future to buy a
    car which is measurable.</span
  >
</p>

<p>
  <b><span style="color: #01897b;">Time Based</span></b> - I want to buy a car
  in 2 years. <br />
  <span style="font-style: italic;"
    >- Here, I defined my time frame that is 2 years. Within that time I have to save 10 lacs to fulfill my requirements.
  </span>
</p>

<p>
  <b
    ><span style="color: #ffc928;">Attainable </span> &
    <span style="color: #7db343;"> Realistic </span></b
  ><br />
  <span style="font-style: italic;"
    >- These 2 go in line with each other if I said that I want to buy a ferrari
    in 2 years, It's neither attainable nor realistic in near future.</span
  >
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We need to set smart goals that can be achievable and realistic otherwise
  sometimes it will lead to disappointment by not achieving it. So before starting set smart goals and based on that decide which investment option
  is suitable for you.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justtify;">
  Now, we know <b>What is smart goals</b>, and <b>How to set smart goals? </b> But do
  we actually know how to achieve them? So let's checkout
  <b style="color: #000080;">How to achieve smart goals ? üéØ </b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justtify;">
  To achieve goals arrange them in order of their time to reach. Usually, goals
  can be divided into 3 parts.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="color: #cd00ea;">Short Term - (0-2 yrs) <br /></span>
  <span style="color: #ba00e5;">Medium Term - (2-7 yrs) <br /></span>
  <span style="color: #a200e0;">Long Term - (7 yrs and more) </span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now, again these categories depend on individuals some of you might have just
  started working, some have just married, some might have at the age of thier
  retirment. So as per your requirement, categories your goals based on time and
  start investing accordingly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We will now see various investment options available. But wait, every good story
  has a villain!!! Then think who is the villain in our story that stop us to achieve our
  goals ?

  How inflation effect our investment ?
</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   Today, you bought some goods for 100 rupees at the inflation rate of 4%, a year later to buy the same quantity of goods you need to pay 104 or you can say
   that value of money decreased by 4 rupees. <br/>

   Suppose you have parked 1,00,000 Rs in fixed deposit at the interest rate of 7%.
<pre>
  Initial Investment    - 1,00,000
  Interest Rate         - 7%
  1 yr Return           - 1,07,000
  Inflation Rate        - 4%
  Net Return            - 1,03,000
</pre>
After a year net return is 1,03,000 which is only 3% of your investment. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
  You might have question how can we beat or reduce the effect of inflation
on our investment? for that you need to be familier with 8<sup>th</sup> wonder of world and that we will have some interesting talk in next blog upto that "STAY HOME STAY SAFE".‚úåÔ∏èüòÄ
