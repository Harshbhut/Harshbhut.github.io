  - Why we need to Invest ?
</h2> -->

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Hi Friends, From the money perspective we all want to become financially
  stable so we will take care of our expenses and our retirement. For that we
  work... earn... spend and somehow save from our salary or business. By
  following this pattern are we sure that we will have peacefull retirement and
  enough fund for
  <b>emergency event</b> ? Are we sure that we are
  <b> financially independent </b> to handle such situation ?
