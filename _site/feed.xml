  What is Financial Independence ?
&lt;/h4&gt; --&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &quot;A goal without a plan is just a wish&quot; - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  I hope you have done your analysis on your spending habits and started saving
  money by cutting down your undesired wants and spending habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, We have some amount of cash in our hands to start investing in various
  available options in the market. Some of you might already be started investing in
  mutual funds but before started investing in any instrument, think for a second
  and ask yourself a question &lt;b&gt;Do I have any specific goal to Invest?  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  If your answer is &lt;b style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;No&lt;/b&gt;, Then it sounds like
  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; color: #808080;&quot;&gt;
    &quot;you are sitting in a taxi and asking a driver to just move
    wherever he wants to go and when he asks for a destination, you just tell him
    keep going I will tell you where I want to go afterward.
  &lt;/span&gt;
  this should not belong to us, right? We should have a destination to go in journey as well as in investment. We must have a specific goal and a plan to fulfill it, So
  let's check out how to set our smart goals in investing.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &quot;
  alt=&quot;Smart Goals&quot;
/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Let's understand it in terms of investing by an example. The actual scenario might
  different and it's based on the individual.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #de4645;&quot;&gt;Specific&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - I want to buy a car.
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
    - Here, I want to buy something and that is a car, so it's a specific
    goal.&lt;/span
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f9a824;&quot;&gt;Measurable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - I need to save 10
  Lacs to buy a car. &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;
    &gt;- Here, I require specific amount that will need in future to buy a
    car which is measurable.&lt;/span
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #01897b;&quot;&gt;Time Based&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - I want to buy a car
  in 2 years. &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;
    &gt;- Here, I defined my time frame that is 2 years. Within that time I have to save 10 lacs to fulfill my requirements.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b
    &gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffc928;&quot;&gt;Attainable &lt;/span&gt; &amp;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #7db343;&quot;&gt; Realistic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b
  &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;
    &gt;- These 2 go in line with each other if I said that I want to buy a ferrari
    in 2 years, It's neither attainable nor realistic in near future.&lt;/span
  &gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  We need to set smart goals that can be achievable and realistic otherwise
  sometimes it will lead to disappointment by not achieving it. So before starting set smart goals and based on that decide which investment option
  is suitable for you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justtify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, we know &lt;b&gt;What is smart goals&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;How to set smart goals? &lt;/b&gt; But do
  we actually know how to achieve them? So let's checkout
  &lt;b style=&quot;color: #000080;&quot;&gt;How to achieve smart goals ? üéØ &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justtify;&quot;&gt;
  To achieve goals arrange them in order of their time to reach. Usually, goals
  can be divided into 3 parts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #cd00ea;&quot;&gt;Short Term - (0-2 yrs) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba00e5;&quot;&gt;Medium Term - (2-7 yrs) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a200e0;&quot;&gt;Long Term - (7 yrs and more) &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  Now, again these categories depend on individuals some of you might have just
  started working, some have just married, some might have at the age of thier
  retirment. So as per your requirement, categories your goals based on time and
  start investing accordingly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
  We will now see various investment options available. But wait, every good story
  has a villain!!! Then think who is the villain in our story that stop us to achieve our
  goals ?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red; font-size: 35px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;üòà INFLATION üòà&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
      &quot;Inflation is taxation without legislation.&quot; - Milton Friedman
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &quot;Inflation is a quantitative measure of the rate at which the average price
  level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy increases over
  some period of time.&quot; - Wikipedia
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/inflation-rate-india.webp&quot; style=&quot; width: 100%; height: auto
!important; max-width: 1000px; -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic; &quot; alt=&quot;Inflation
rate in India from 1984 to 2024 (compared to the previous year)&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;sources:- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com&quot;&gt;Statista&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4 style=&quot;color: #000080;&quot;&gt;
  How inflation effect our investment ?
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
   Today, you bought some goods for 100 rupees at the inflation rate of 4%, a year later to buy the same quantity of goods you need to pay 104 or you can say
   that value of money decreased by 4 rupees. &lt;br/&gt;

   Suppose you have parked 1,00,000 Rs in fixed deposit at the interest rate of 7%.
&lt;pre&gt;
  Initial Investment    - 1,00,000
  Interest Rate         - 7%
  1 yr Return           - 1,07,000
  Inflation Rate        - 4%
  Net Return            - 1,03,000
&lt;/pre&gt;
After a year net return is 1,03,000 which is only 3% of your investment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;
  You might have question how can we beat or reduce the effect of inflation
on our investment? for that you need to be familier with 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; wonder of world and that we will have some interesting talk in next blog upto that &quot;STAY HOME STAY SAFE&quot;.‚úåÔ∏èüòÄ

  What is Financial Independence ?
&lt;/h4&gt; --&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &quot;It's not your salary that makes you rich, it's your spending habits&quot; -
  Charles Jaffe
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I think before moving towards the first step of financial independence, it's
  better to understand the most basic concept of the financial world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img
  src=&quot;/img/posts/Savings vs Investment.webp&quot;
  style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;
  alt=&quot;Saving vs Investment&quot;
/&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Now, We can say that we should maintain a balance between these 
  2 in life to become financially independent but without having most 
  powerful instrument it isn't possible, Can you guess what?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red; font-size: 35px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;üí∞ MONEY üí∞&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
      &quot;It takes money to make more money&quot;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
  It's your &lt;b&gt; Spending Habits &amp; Money Management &lt;/b&gt; will decide wheather you will be successful
  in financial independence or not. Let's checkout average spending by common men
  from their income.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;
  Total Monthly Income                :  40000
  Essential Items                     : -10000
  EMI(Car, Home, Credit,Insurance)    : -20000
  Luxury                              : -3000
  Savings                             : -5000
  Other items                         : -2000
                                      --------- 
                                          &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;   
  &lt;/pre&gt;
The main intension to show this calculation is that people are so much engaged in the daily work that they don't know about their spending habits. Money comes and goes in no matter of time from their pocket, Think about yourself and find out in which category you are? ü§î &lt;br&gt;
Analyze your spending habits by looking at your past 1-2 month expenses and savings trying to make an excel from that workout you will understand the 
inflow and outflow of your money from your pocket.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Now, you might think that our income amount is the root of all our problems. Having a very small amount of income how can 
  we save or invest after all my expenses? you are right, Income is not directly in our hand but what is definitely in our hand
  is &lt;b&gt;expenses&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, you might ask how to cut down expenses to save? I assume that you have done your analysis for your past few month's savings and expenses. So currently the calculation is to be &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Savings = Income - Expenditure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
but ideally it should be &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0609d4;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expenditure = Income - Savings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you follow this habit then in a short time
you will have good amount of savings. Now, again you might have a question that how much I should save from my income? So Let's Checkout.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img
  srcset=&quot;
    /img/posts/fifty-thirty-twenty-rule-390w.webp 390w,
    /img/posts/fifty-thirty-twenty-rule.webp     800w

  sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 390px,
            800px&quot;
  src=&quot;/img/posts/fifty-thirty-twenty-rule.webp&quot;
  alt=&quot;50-30-20 Rule&quot;
/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, You already have a list of your spending habits for the past 1-2 months try to categorize items in above mentioned rule. Try to cut down 5% from needs &amp; wants categories and add that part of the money into your savings category. 
Try as much as you can cut down your expenses, better you reduce earlier sooner you will achieve your &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0609d4;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Financial Independence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I know this is not very easy to suddenly change your lifestyle but believe me you can develop this &lt;b&gt;habit&lt;/b&gt; overtime by practice and 
  patience. In the next blog, I will explain smart goals and our enemy in investment.‚úåÔ∏èüòÄ

  What is Financial Independence ?
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  Financial independence is the status of having enough income to pay one's
  living expenses for the rest of one's life without having to be employed or
  dependent on others.Income earned without having to work a job is commonly
  referred to as passive income. - Wikipedia
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Now, You might think that why am I reading this ? Let me close the page and do
  my work but wait hold on for a minute. Just ask these questions to yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
  - Do I have any passive income ? &lt;br /&gt;
  - Do I have emergency fund that last 6 months ? &lt;br /&gt;
  - Do I have plan my life after retirment ? &lt;br /&gt;- Do I have any financial
  stability that pays my debt if I lost my job or business ?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  If you don't have answers then you should consider to change your spending and
  saving habit so it will help you to save from falling into financial trap.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
