  What is Financial Independence ?
&lt;/h4&gt; --&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &quot;It's not your salary that makes you rich, it's your spending habits&quot; -
  Charles Jaffe
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  I think before moving towards the first step of financial independence, it's
  better to understand the most basic concept of the financial world.
&lt;/p&gt;

  alt=&quot;Saving vs Investment&quot;
/&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Now, We can say that we should maintain a balance between these 
  2 in life to become financially independent but without having most 
  powerful instrument it isn't possible, Can you guess what?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: red; font-size: 35px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;üí∞ MONEY üí∞&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
      &quot;It takes money to make more money&quot;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
  It's your &lt;b&gt; Spending Habits &amp; Money Management &lt;/b&gt; will decide wheather you will be successful
  in financial independence or not. Let's checkout average spending by common men
  from their income.&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;
  Total Monthly Income                :  40000
  Essential Items                     : -10000
  EMI(Car, Home, Credit,Insurance)    : -20000
  Luxury                              : -3000
  Savings                             : -5000
  Other items                         : -2000
                                      --------- 
                                          &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;   
  &lt;/pre&gt;
The main intension to show this calculation is that people are so much engaged in the daily work that they don't know about their spending habits. Money comes and goes in no matter of time from their pocket, Think about yourself and find out in which category you are? ü§î &lt;br&gt;
Analyze your spending habits by looking at your past 1-2 month expenses and savings trying to make an excel from that workout you will understand the 
inflow and outflow of your money from your pocket.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Now, you might think that our income amount is the root of all our problems. Having a very small amount of income how can 
  we save or invest after all my expenses? you are right, Income is not directly in our hand but what is definitely in our hand
  is &lt;b&gt;expenses&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, you might ask how to cut down expenses to save? I assume that you have done your analysis for your past few month's savings and expenses. So currently the calculation is to be &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Savings = Income - Expenditure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
but ideally it should be &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0609d4;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expenditure = Income - Savings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you follow this habit then in a short time
you will have good amount of savings. Now, again you might have a question that how much I should save from my income? So Let's Checkout.
&lt;/p&gt;

  src=&quot;/img/posts/fifty-thirty-twenty-rule.webp&quot;
  alt=&quot;50-30-20 Rule&quot;
/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, You already have a list of your spending habits for the past 1-2 months try to categorize items in above mentioned rule. Try to cut down 5% from needs &amp; wants categories and add that part of the money into your savings category. 
Try as much as you can cut down your expenses, better you reduce earlier sooner you will achieve your &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0609d4;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Financial Independence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I know this is not very easy to suddenly change your lifestyle but believe me you can develop this &lt;b&gt;habit&lt;/b&gt; overtime by practice and 
  patience. In the next blog, I will explain smart goals and our enemy in investment.‚úåÔ∏èüòÄ

  What is Financial Independence ?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
  Financial independence is the status of having enough income to pay one's
  living expenses for the rest of one's life without having to be employed or
  dependent on others.Income earned without having to work a job is commonly
  referred to as passive income. - Wikipedia
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
  Now, You might think that why am I reading this ? Let me close the page and do
  my work but wait hold on for a minute. Just ask these questions to yourself.

&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;
  - Do I have any passive income ? &lt;br /&gt;
  - Do I have emergency fund that last 6 months ? &lt;br /&gt;
  - Do I have plan my life after retirment ? &lt;br /&gt;- Do I have any financial
  stability that pays my debt if I lost my job or business ?
